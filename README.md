This repository provides a practice .Rmd file to knit (render).

# Instructions for this Assignment (Exercise: Git, GitHub, and RStudio)

1. Work through chapters 6-13 of the git tutorial at https://happygitwithr.com/ (Links to an external site.). At a bare minimum, get RStudio talking to git on your local machine; try to get RStudio talking to GitHub.
2. Make an account on GitHub. Create a repository you can use for future ANGSD assignments. Submit a link to this repository. Not that if you choose to make this repository private, then you should make sure Merv (mfansler), Friederike (friedue), and Luce (lskrbnek) all have access to it (Links to an external site.). (1pt)
3. Next, on GitHub create a fork of the repository from the practice exercise (Links to an external site.). (1pt)
4. Clone a copy of your fork to your local machine and open it as New Project, in RStudio. Hint: See section 12.3 in the tutorial.
5. In RStudio, edit the practice.Rmd to have your name as the author and a better title, save the changes, and stage the changes with git. (1pt)
6. In RStudio, knit (render) the Rmarkdown document, then add that HTML or PDF file with git (1pt).
Commit the staged files (be sure to provide a concise, yet informative commit message), then push the changes to your GitHub repository.
